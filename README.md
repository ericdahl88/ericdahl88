- 👋 Hi there, I’m Eric Brian Dahl.
- 👀 I’m an economist with strong financial and investment background and now I'm interested in improving my data analyst skills.
- 🤓 My last experiences as a data analyst were working for the government in statistical analysis to furnish insights for elaborating public policy and developed automatic processes to boost routine report timing. During those years, I learnt SQL and IBM SPSS Statistics to perform ETL and statistical analysis plus reporting.
- 🌱 Currently, I’m learning applied data science with Python.
- 😁 My soft skills rely on working with cross-functional and multidisciplinary teams at banks, government agencies and universities.
- 💞️ Now, I’m looking to collaborate on project related to investments and financial market analysis.
